          I am an athlete at heart, with an entrepreneurial spirit, a knack for online security, and a passion for coding. Having returned from my year of traveling, I pursued my first development job to kick off my career. I was hired as a full stack developer by Shop Your Own Mortgage, where I still work today. Since beginning my career there, I have been given the opportunity to shift into cybersecurity for the company. I am currently working towards my Certified Ethical Hacker certification while working as a full stack developer and lead security specialist.
